## The Game Of Go

Go (simplified Chinese: 围棋; traditional Chinese: 圍棋; pinyin: wéiqí, Japanese: 囲碁 igo,  Korean: 바둑 baduk) is a board game involving two players that originated in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago. It was considered one of the four essential arts of a cultured Chinese scholar in antiquity. Its earliest written reference dates back to the Confucian Analects.

There is significant strategy involved in the game, and the number of possible games is vast (10^761 compared, for example, to the 10^120 possible in chess), despite its relatively simple rules.

Go is a very difficlt game for computers to play well and professional players still beat the strongest AIs.
